# Link capturing 

HELLOO..... POPPIT :)

This simple puppeteer script scrapes all links on the associated target and prints them into a txt file. The output is cleaner compared to a Kali Dragon application and because puppeteer is a master API key, using the backend shadows, nothing can hide from your scrape while your a hidden Shinobi- 

const Stealth = require('stealth');

** This script can replace and/or improve functionality and data research for Pen-Testing applications like 
{ Burp/Zap/ >= --(ect);
))};


What does it all mean, WItCH?

IT MEANS----

1. This script will scan and print all links assoicated with your url. Showing if you have been exploited and if someone is piggybacking on your application. ( redirects, http, php, ect )
2. Similar to ZAP, { (better if used in conjunction) ; wink, wink)}; but with a much cleaner output interface for assoicated links to inspect.
